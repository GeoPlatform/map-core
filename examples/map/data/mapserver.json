The US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) in the Environmental Public Health Division (EPHD) is currently engaged in research aimed at developing a measure that estimates overall environmental quality at the county level for the United States. A better way to calculate overall environmental quality is needed for researchers who study the environment and its effects on human health. The EQI was developed for all counties in the United States for the period 2000-2005. The EQI represents five areas (called “domains”) of the environment: [1] air, [2] water, [3] land, [4] built, and [5] sociodemographic. In addition to the EQI, there is an index for each of the five domains. The EQI accounts for environmental differences between urban and rural areas by grouping counties into one of four rural-urban continuum codes (RUCCs), ranging from highly urban to rural-isolated areas. NOTE: low EQI scores represent better environmental quality while higher EQI scores represent poorer environmental quality. For more information on the development of the EQI, there is an overview report as well as a more detailed technical report at https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/NHEERL/EQI\n\nThe four RUCC groups were used to account for differences in rural versus urban areas. There were originally nine RUCC codes. Those nine were combined to make four RUCCs for the EQI: (1) RUCC1 represents metropolitan-urbanized = codes 1+2+3; (2) RUCC2 nonmetropolitan-urbanized = 4+5; (3) RUCC3 less urbanized = 6+7; and (4) RUCC4 thinly populated (rural) =8+9",
